YCommunicator-Android
=====================

This package is an "Android App for Dummies". 
It's intended to get you started fast with:
 - Configurable UI that allows you to add Buttons, Scroll bars, Text-edits and Labels to the App's interface.
 - Attach a YCommunicator Command to each control.
 - Connect to a remote device via Bluetooth.
 
The app uses [YCommunicator-Java](https://github.com/oyagev/YCommunicator-Java) package for full YCommunicator implementation.
